When you are learning to program one of the first pieces of advice that you seem to hear is "Start a blog".
This is good advice, but rarely followed, so I'm going to give you the step by step rundown on how
I went about creating this blog.

1. Find some topic that is so important that you neeeed to write a blog post about it.
2. Register a hip or otherwise witty domain name. I recommend using [Hover][hover].
3. Scour the web for the perfect blogging engine.
4. Try out four to five of these platforms, decide for minor reasons that none of them quite meets
your exact specifications.
5. Roll your own platform. Use Rails and bootstrap.
6. Abandon your first attempt because Rails / Bootstrap are too heavy, and besides everyone has done
that already
7. In your next attempt use some obscure JavaScript library with almost no documentation because you want to try it out.
8. Bang you head against a wall repeatedly.
9. Abandon the JavaScript library and choose [Sinatra][sinatra] and [Pure.css][pure].
10. Successfully create your own blogging platform.
9. Forget want you wanted to write an article about.
