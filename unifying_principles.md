Title: Unifying Principles  
Comments: True  

A 'long' time ago, my dad wrote down a bunch of unifying principles,
I think they are great, here they are:

#Unifying Principles

+ **Nothing really matters.** Remind yourself that life is absurd; choose your own reasons to live.
+ **Family first in all cases.** After all they are an extension of yourself.
+ **Friends count big.** Keep them and stand by them.
+ **Rules are for fools.** Make your own.  Live near the edge.
+ **Be spontaneous.** Rely on your own ability to make the right decision when the time comes.
+ **Follow your passions.** Don’t let an overly pragmatic approach stop you from doing what you love.
+ **Experiences are like jewels on a chain; the more you collect, the richer you are.**
+ **Judge people for yourself.** Don’t let looks, wealth, status or the opinion of others bias your evaluation.
+ **Do the right thing.** Objective self evaluation should be continuous.
+ **The key to satisfaction is realistic expectations.**
+ **Be enthusiastic.** It is contagious.

##Possible Additions:

+ **One thing at a time.** Trying to do too much at once means nothing ever gets DONE.
+ **Make a plan.** Indecisiveness helps no one.
